Hey Guys,

Again, as we had mentioned on our conference call, the CMS templates basically inplement a modular approach. If we break things out in this way, we can more easily
map Sparkbox template elements to my template elements.

So, there are three template types that our CMS (REIgnition, by BarkleyREI) uses:

1) Layout Templates - top-level template files which establish the main HTML of the page.
2) Template Parts - additional static HTML elements injected into layout template(s). Used for headers, footers,
       and other static HTML elements.
3) Transformation Templates - dynamic HTML elements injected into layout templates(s). Used for news 
       and event feeds, faculty bios, and other dynamic CMS-specific data sources. Generated by XSLT.

The latter two types allow for a mix-and-max extensiblity, which I rely on heavily.

Anyway, For the purposes of this project, we really only need to concentrate on a single Layout Template, which I
  have exported and named SB-Home-ALT-Template.html. You will see the inclusion of the other template parts or transformation
  templates in this top-level file.

I will use a .txt naming convention for Template Parts, as they are not complete HTML documents.

I will use an .xsl naming convention for Transformation Templates, since this is what they contain.

Finally, I have included SB-HOME-ALT.html, which is just the source of the dynamically generated home page, saved as static HTML.

NOTE: I have also included a .JPG mock-up of what we would now like the modified Program menu to look like (for full browser viewports).

Thanks,

   Bob
